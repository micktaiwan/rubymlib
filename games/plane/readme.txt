It will never be finished, I know it, but there you will find a little fantasy of mine.
Build a plane simulation, yeah, with forces and all. I am a big fan of Flight Simulator, this is my goal.
Well my goal is actually to learn vectors, forces, opengl, that'all :)
I think I may live 40 more years. So I still got time. :)
